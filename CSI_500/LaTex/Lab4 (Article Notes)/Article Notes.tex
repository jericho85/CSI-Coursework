This is a short summary of key points from a T.S. Robertson article, per an assignment in the GMU Course CSI 500 by Dr. Stephen Scott.

\section{Key Points:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item "Innovation takes place via a process whereby a new 'thought, behavior, or thing' is conceived of and brought into reality." ~ Scott
	\item "No innovation springs full-blown out of nothing; it must have antecedents."
	~ Barnett, as quoted by Scott.
	\item Diffusion of innovation occurs along a curve or statistical distribution where the initial participants are the most socially influential in the diffusion of innovation.
	\item This can be more valuable than traditional advertising, a fact that the marketing industry has noted and now is academically included in relevant curriculum.
	\item This is evident in the current market selection of social influencers, and can be tracked through new product releases through these individuals in social media: this agrees with the final point of the article, in that it shows the history of the concerns expressed being mitigated by marketing innovators through specific action.
\end{itemize}
