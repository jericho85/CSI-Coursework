Things that I did wrong:
    1) Initialized all weights to the same value. This caused my hidden outputs to all remain the same
    2) Set unrealistic stopping conditions. This caused my model to train indefinitely or to stop far too soon
    3) Did not train long enough manually. This caused the model to essentially be as accurate as random guesses
    4) Used binary outputs for hidden neurons. This just... doesn't work at all
    5) removed activation function from hidden neurons. This was before other problems, so I do not know the actual impact other than the optimization would be making steps that were inappropriate
